# unity-argon-assault-2023

Small 3D space shooter game built with Unity

![Cover](./github_assets/cover.png)

This project is done as part of the **Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D course** instructed by Ben Tristem. Within the scope of this undertaking, I gained proficiency in crafting custom terrains, adeptly navigated through timeline functionality, and successfully delved into fundamental UI manipulation techniques.

## How to play

The goal of the game is to reach the landing pad (yellow) by maneuvering through the obstacles.
